Description:
Developed a text-based arcade-style car dodging game entirely in Java, playable within the console. The objective is to control a car and avoid incoming enemy vehicles (represented as obstacles) while scoring points for every enemy successfully dodged. The game increases in difficulty as more enemies appear and speed remains constant to maintain challenge.

Key Features:

Real-time gameplay: Implemented with a continuous game loop and dynamic screen refresh.

Keyboard controls: Support for left (A), right (D), pause (P), and quit (Q) keys.

Randomized obstacles: Enemy positions are generated using Java’s Random class to ensure unpredictability.

Score tracking: Increments the player’s score for each successfully dodged enemy.

Collision detection: Ends the game if the player’s car and an enemy occupy the same lane position.

Pause & resume: Allows players to temporarily halt gameplay without losing progress.

Console UI: Uses a 2D character array to draw boundaries, the car, and enemies in the console.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Java

Core Concepts Used: 2D arrays, loops, conditional statements, random number generation, keyboard input handling, console-based rendering, and basic game loop logic.

Learning Outcomes:

Gained experience in implementing real-time game mechanics in a console environment.

Enhanced understanding of array manipulation for graphical representation in text mode.

Practiced user input handling and collision detection logic in Java.
